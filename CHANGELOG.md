# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- **The plugin is renamed `dsh-session-pin` → `dsh-session-emoji`.** The package, plugin/entry id (`SETTINGS_ENTRY_ID` and the shipped `cordis.patch.yml` row id), locale namespace, `sessions.row.action` contribution id, CSS class prefix (`__dsh-session-emoji-*`), picker option ids (`dsh-session-emoji-option-<n>`), browser-local key (`dsh.session-emoji.pinned`), capability id, repository metadata, and the five READMEs move together. An existing profile does not start empty: `src/legacy-import.ts` folds the former `session-pin` entry's pin lists, emoji maps, recents, and organizer state into the new namespace once, and only into fields that are still empty — a profile already using this plugin keeps its own state, and a second run is a no-op. Without that entry the retired browser-local key `dsh.session-pin.pinned` is read once as a fallback (read-only, never written). The `session/pin` log-event name and the historical entries below are deliberately unchanged, so log-backed projections stay readable.
- **The built `lib/` is committed so the git channel works on pnpm ≥10.** pnpm refuses to run a dependency's build scripts unless the profile allow-lists it, and that allow-list key is the resolved commit sha, so a source install from GitHub can never build the plugin; the bundle is tracked with `git add -f lib/` (it stays in `.gitignore` so tooling skips it), and `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:TheBigFish/dsh-session-emoji#main"` ships that checked-in build. Rebuild (`pnpm run build`) and commit it with any source change — `ci.yml` fails when `lib/` is not committed or differs from a fresh build. The npm channel is unaffected (the release workflow builds and packs the fresh output, and a packed tarball never carries the build script).
- **Row colors are replaced by per-row emoji picked from a searchable popover.** The `[pin][swatch]` pair becomes `[pin][emoji]` everywhere it appears (session row, workspace row, DOM overlay, and the React row slot): clicking the circle after the pin opens an anchored picker with the recently used emoji (up to 12, most-recent-first), eight category tabs, zh/en name and keyword search, and full keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter, Esc). Clicking the currently selected emoji again — or Shift+clicking the row button — clears the badge. The row tint and left accent bar are gone; a row carries one emoji and keeps its normal background, and an unset badge shows as an empty circle so the button stays discoverable. The pinned panel shows each row's emoji read-only next to the existing board/tag controls. One picker instance is shared by both row paths and closes on outside click, anchor removal, or cleanup.
- **The stored model renames the color maps and grows a recents list.** `colors → emoji`, `workspaceColors → workspaceEmoji`, plus a new `recentEmoji` array; the durable document envelope moves to v4 while v1–v3 documents still decode — with the retired color maps deliberately dropped. Normalization stays fail-closed: a stored emoji is accepted only when it exists in the shipped catalog. The `session/pin` event now carries `emoji` instead of `color`, the projection folds it, and `mirrorSessionPin` writes `{ pinned, emoji }`; a legacy `color` field in an existing log entry is ignored, never replayed as state.
- **`emoji`/`workspaceEmoji`/`recentEmoji` are `.volatile()` fields of the plugin's own live Config**, alongside the pin lists and organizer state, so the Plugins page can edit them and the browser half reads them through `ctx.configForms.get(entryId)` as before. A migrated `cordis.patch.yml` row needs no manual action: retired keys such as `colors`/`workspaceColors` are ignored on load and never read back as state (they do stay in the YAML, so deleting them by hand is the only remaining cleanup).

### Added

- `src/emoji-data.ts` — generated, checked-in catalog: 1653 fully-qualified sequences across eight categories (smileys, people, animals, food, travel, activities, objects, symbols) with CLDR English and Simplified-Chinese names plus keywords; flags, components, and skin-tone sequences are filtered out so every entry renders as a single badge.
- `src/emoji-catalog.ts` — module-load index of the catalog with `emojiLabel`, exact-match lookup, per-category row access, and token-AND search capped at 120 rows (a pasted emoji resolves first).
- `src/emoji-picker.ts` — framework-free DOM picker anchored to the row button with recents strip, category tabs, search box, roving tab stop, fixed-position clamping, and outside-click dismissal; every option carries a stable `dsh-session-emoji-option-<index>` id for tests.
- `scripts/generate-emoji-data.mjs` and the `pnpm run emoji:generate` script — rebuilds the dataset from `emoji-test.txt` (Unicode 18.0) and CLDR `annotations/{en,zh}.json`, cached under `.cache/`; the build, CI, and runtime never fetch anything. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` records the Unicode License v3 attribution.
- Test coverage for the new surface: `tests/emoji-catalog.test.ts` (12) and `tests/emoji-picker.test.ts` (18), plus emoji assertions threaded through the existing core/store/controller/log/overlay/row-slot/registration/inject/reorder suites. The write path gained its own regression cases in `tests/pin-store.test.ts` and `tests/pin-controller.test.ts`: in-order and coalesced host writes, the refusal retry, and the stale-echo/pending-write state that the live browser pass exposed.

### Removed

- The 8-color preset palette, the cycle button, the row tint and accent bar, the `color` event field, and the `colors`/`workspaceColors` storage fields. Stored hex colors are dropped on migration rather than re-interpreted as emoji.

### Fixed

- **Rapid pin/emoji clicks can no longer end up reverted on the Host.** The settings round trip answers each field about a second later, so a burst used to queue one write per click and could deliver an older value last — a rapid unpin→pin pair landed on the Host as *unpinned* while the sidebar showed it pinned, invisible until the next reload. Host writes are now serialized per field, coalesced latest-wins while a write is in flight, and the client keeps the committed value visible until the Host echoes it back; a write the Host refuses (a revision conflict with a concurrent document edit, answered as `false` rather than an error) is retried once against the refreshed revision and only then rolled back.
- **A settings write in flight is now observable.** `PinReadFace.hasPendingWrites()` reports whether a committed field still awaits its Host echo, the sidebar foot action carries `data-pending`, and the browser pass waits for that acknowledgement before reloading so a queued write cannot be dropped by the page teardown.

## [0.7.16] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- Host pins move to `0.1.7-rc.2`; re-verified against that host line. Every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test dependency now pins `0.1.7-rc.2`, the `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions` timeline appends `0.1.7-rc.2`, and the compatibility baseline in every README records the `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2` host. The declared host ranges (`engines.dsh` and the `peerDependencies` union) are deliberately **unchanged** — they already admit `0.1.7-rc.2`, and a range is what the manifest accepts, not what has been tested.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-09-24
### Fixed

- `tests/host-registration.test.ts` carried three mojibake em dashes: one in the header comment and two inside the merge-base comment of the folded-pin test, where the pair also swallowed the line break and the following indentation and left two comments fused into one 150-column line. All three dashes are restored and the swallowed break is put back, so the file is free of encoding artifacts and no longer contains an over-long fused comment.

### Changed

- The host pins move to `0.1.7-rc.1`: every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test pin moves from `0.1.7-alpha.2`, and `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions` records `0.1.7-rc.1` (appended — the timeline stays append-only). Re-verified against that host line. The declared peer ranges and `engines.dsh` are deliberately **unchanged**: `0.1.7-rc.1` already satisfies their `>=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0` clause, and the family keeps peer ranges wider than the verified line rather than narrowing them to it.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **Re-verified against the `0.1.7-alpha.2` host; the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` host pins move to `0.1.7-alpha.2`.** The `alpha.2` wave removes nothing this plugin consumes: the published type surface of every host package it resolves is either byte-identical to `0.1.7-alpha.1` (`@deepseek-ai/cordis` `4.0.3`≡`4.0.4`, `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` `3.18.3`≡`3.18.4`) or strictly additive (`ToolDefinition.projectContent?`, `ClientModuleLoader.importError()`, six added `dsh-client-locale` keys). The wave's only removals are internals no plugin in this family references — `dsh-subprocess-local` privates and its non-entry `bindManagedProcess`, `dsh-client-web` `assertEntriesActive`, `dsh-app-boot`'s `unhandledRejection` event, `dsh-client-ui-plugin-manager` `apply()`, a refined `dsh-client-ui-primitives` `CodeBlock` signature, and the `diff.files.one`/`diff.files.other` locale key pair. Both rulers therefore stay green on the moved pin: `typecheck` against the checkout, `typecheck:ci` against the published `0.1.7-alpha.2` faces.
- The declared host range is deliberately **unchanged**. It already admits `0.1.7-alpha.2` (`0.1.7-alpha.2` satisfies the `>=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0` clause), and the family convention keeps peer ranges wider than the verified line rather than narrowing them to it; a range is what the manifest accepts, not what has been tested.
- Repo documentation (`AGENTS.md`), the workspace graph pin (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) and the published-line workflow pins move with the manifest, so no file still claims the previous line.


## [0.7.13] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- **Host half migrated to the `0.1.7` settings contract — the plugin's durable settings surface is now its own live Config.** `ctx.settings.register(ns, schema, { base, applies })` and the whole `SettingsProvider` / `SettingsScope` / `SettingsNamespace` / `SettingsRegisterOptions` family were deleted from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings` (which is now `SettingsForms`), and the old call site is gone. **Editable-surface decision:** the removed namespace held two distinct kinds of field, and only one of them was a host-only policy mirror. The pin data (`pinned`, `workspacePinned`, `colors`, `workspaceColors`, `boards`, `tags`, `views`) was genuinely user-editable durable configuration — the browser half wrote it through the settings scope and the removed provider persisted it — so its correct landing point is the **volatile Config fields**, and the same is true of the eight policy/switches the browser half READS from the resolved snapshot (`maxPins`, `reorderOnLoad`, `pruneStale`, `enableBoards`, `enableTags`, `enableViews`, `enableHealth`, `enableGoto`): under the new model a client's only view of a host entry is its volatile fields, so leaving them ordinary would have silently dropped a configured `maxPins` in the browser. `enableLogBacking` stays **ordinary** Config — it was never a field of the old namespace and no browser half reads it — so no new editable surface was invented. Every default is unchanged, and `.volatile()` sits on a fixed object path in each case (the schemastery constraint).
- **Settings form namespace = the profile entry id.** On the new contract a form is named by the local id of its profile entry, so `cordis.patch.yml`'s `id: session-pin` row is the namespace; the host half exports it as `SETTINGS_ENTRY_ID` and claims its presentation policy with `ctx.settings.configure({ auto: true }, ctx.fiber)` inside an effect (the generated form IS the plugin's settings page — the plugin ships no custom one). No user-visible setting moved or was renamed: the same fields, the same defaults, now edited from the profile's Plugins page instead of `settings.yaml`.
- **Client half migrated off the deleted `ctx.settingsScope` service.** `settingsScope.bind({ namespace })` was removed from the host packages (`git grep settingsScope -- packages` is empty on `0.1.7-alpha.1`), and because it stayed in the plugin's `inject` list the browser half could no longer activate at all. It now reads the same form through `ctx.configForms.get(entryId)` — `ConfigForm<T>{ getSnapshot, subscribe, set, unset, mutate }`, the documented successor with the same snapshot/subscribe/write shape, so `PinStore`'s host/local mode switch and per-field write path are unchanged; `remote` is dropped from `inject` (the settings provider owns that transport) and the `PinScope` write contract is widened to the acceptance boolean `ConfigForm.set` answers with.
- **Log-backed projection mirror now writes through the settings service.** `mirrorSessionPin` reads its merge base from the plugin's own stable volatile references (`config.pinned.get()` / `config.colors.get()`) — the live resolved value, exactly what `scope.get()` returned — and writes with `ctx.settings.update('session-pin', { pinned, colors })`, which merges into the profile entry's override layer exactly as the removed `scope.update()` did. Semantics (pin to front, unpin, set/clear color, best-effort containment) are unchanged.
- **Raise the dev/test dependency line to `0.1.7-alpha.1`** (= the verified host tag) and add the fourth `>=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0` clause to `engines.dsh` and every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peer range (widening only — no supported host line is dropped); `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions` and the Compat workflow move to the same tag. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` moves to `^4.0.3` and `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` to `^3.18.3`: only those releases export `Volatile`/`isVolatile` and `Schema.prototype.volatile`, and they resolve `@deepseek-ai/cosmokit` `1.8.4`. **Deviation from the batch plan:** the instructed `0.1.5-rc.3` target was measured and rejected — that `next`-line release still ships the OLD `SettingsProvider` contract (verified in its published `lib/types/index.d.ts`), so code written for the host could not typecheck against it.

- **Clicking a pinned row now opens the session.** The browser half navigates through `ISessions.retain(id, { source: 'gateway' })` — the `open` method was removed on the `0.1.6` line (B2) — so clicking a pinned row in the sidebar or the pinned panel opens the session in the current window (the same seam `/goto` uses). The structural client face was updated together with the two call sites; the `retain` disposal is intentionally not held (keeping the session retained is the desired open state).
- **The style node is no longer self-removed.** The plugin's `<style data-plugin="dsh-session-pin">` node is now left for the host's entry lifecycle to remove on unload/reload — self-removal in the disposal flush could also delete other plugins' style nodes (N8).
- **The log-backed append gate now answers from the runtime event vocabulary.** The old function-source probe (`Function.prototype.toString().includes('ignorable')`) is deleted: on the alpha line `Session.append` can no longer stamp the `ignorable` marker, so a host whose event vocabulary does not know `session/pin` gets no append at all (one warning before the first write, projection degrades to the settings cache). `allowUnmarked` keeps its deliberately dangerous opt-in meaning.
- **Dead `session.setPinned` typed branch removed; remote commit timeout capped at 300ms** (was 4000ms). The generic connection RPC remains the log-backed write channel.
- **Silent fallbacks now warn once.** The ungrouped-session reorder skip, the missing workspace-reorder RPC, and the missing `startSession` helper each report one warning per plugin mount instead of staying mute (or spamming every click).
- **Raise the dev/test dependency line to `0.1.6-alpha.2`** and declare `dsh.manifestVersion: 1` plus the three-clause `engines.dsh` range (G-3). The peer range already carries the `>=0.1.6-0 <0.2.0` clause (spread by the kit sync).

### Docs

- Five-language READMEs: the compatibility baseline moves to `dsh-v0.1.7-alpha.1` with the four-clause peer range; the "host half" and "data" wording now describes the live Config form rather than a registered settings namespace; the client extension-point list swaps `settingsScope`/`remote` for `configForms`; the uninstall note drops the removed `settings.yaml` section; the Configuration section states which fields are live (volatile) and why `enableLogBacking` is not.
- `AGENTS.md` records the new host/client seams and the `0.1.7-alpha.1` dependency line.
- Five-language READMEs: the compatibility baseline moves to `dsh-v0.1.6-alpha.2` with the three-clause peer range; the `session/pin` gate wording now describes the vocabulary-only criterion; a "click-to-open" bullet documents the pinned-row navigation.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- Rename the four translated READMEs to `README-<lang>.md`. npm selects the package-page readme as the first markdown file matching its `{README,README.*}` glob (`@npmcli/package-json`, publish path), and that glob order puts `README.<lang>.md` ahead of `README.md` — so npm was serving the Simplified-Chinese file for this package too (measured on 15/15 sampled packages of the family). The new names sit outside the glob, so the English source is served again. No content changed apart from the language-switcher link each translation holds to its siblings, and the repo readme gate still passes. Takes effect with the next release; an already-published version cannot gain a corrected readme retroactively.
- Pin the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test dependencies to the published `0.1.5-rc.2` line and record `0.1.5-rc.2` in `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions`; the monthly Compat workflow now runs against `0.1.5-rc.2`. The peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` is unchanged, so no supported host line is dropped.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-09-10


### Fixed

- Stop the pinned-prefix re-assertion from looping on its own echo (issue #4). `reorderMoves` plans its moves for sequential application, but the browser half issued the whole batch concurrently (`void moveToTop(id)`): with three or more pinned sessions in one account every move computed its anchor from the same pre-move snapshot, the resulting order was not the pinned prefix, and the host's list-change broadcast re-planned the same moves — an unbounded `workspace/insertSessionBefore` loop that ends in `net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`. The re-assertion now runs through `src/reorder-pump.ts`: one pass at a time (a list change landing during a pass collapses into a single re-check, so the echo of this client's own confirmed move cannot re-enter the reorder path), moves applied sequentially against the live order, and a plan issued at most once per observed order — replaying the same request sequence against an unchanged order cannot change it, which also bounds the unrelated list-churn path (`connection/reset` re-arms it). The pinned order itself and the `reorderOnLoad` gate are unchanged.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-09-10



### Changed

- Pin the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test dependencies to the published `0.1.5-rc.1` line and record `0.1.5-rc.1` in `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions`; the monthly Compat workflow now runs against `0.1.5-rc.1`. The peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` is unchanged, so no supported host line is dropped.

### Docs

- Refresh the five-language README compatibility baseline to `dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1` (verified 2026-09-10).

## [0.7.8] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Align the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peer ranges to `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0` and pin the dev/test dependencies to the published `0.1.5-alpha.1` line: adaptation to DeepSeek Harness `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` (session format V3, `ctx.agent` removal, `Inbox` type-only interface); runtime behavior is unchanged for every supported host line.
- Record `0.1.5-alpha.1` in `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions`.

### Docs

- Refresh the five-language README compatibility baseline to `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` (verified 2026-09-09).

## [0.7.7] - 2026-09-08

### Docs

- Repair GBK mojibake in the package.json description: the em dash was corrupted to the U+95B3 U+003F marker pair; the description is restored to the clean pre-corruption text; no behavior change.


## [0.7.6] - 2026-09-07

### Docs

- Fix the DSH plugin badge URL: shields.io rejects the four-segment static badge form with "404 badge not found"; the label now uses the documented double-dash form (`dsh--plugin`), rendering identically; no behavior change.


## [0.7.5] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Align the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` peer ranges to `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0`: the older `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0` band resolved to only the `0.1.0-rc.8` prerelease under registry-driven resolution and broke fresh tarball installs; no behavior change.

### Docs

- Refresh the five-language README support-version wording: the verified GitHub tag `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.1` now leads the compatibility claim, while npm `0.1.2-rc.1` stays the published dependency-pin line (peers `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0`); no behavior change.


## [0.7.4] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Align the devDependency pins to the published dsh `0.1.2-rc.1` line (12 `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` packages), the `dshWorkshop` compatibility list, and the compat workflow's CLI/base/headless installs; the five-language READMEs record the rc.1 facts. No behavior change: the pre-flight `session/pin` gate behavior is unchanged on `0.1.2-rc.1` (`Session.append` still cannot stamp the `ignorable` marker).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-09-02

### Docs

- Sync the five-language READMEs to the 0.1.2-alpha.5 facts; no behavior change.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Align the devDependency pins to the published dsh 0.1.2-alpha.5 line and re-verify the adaptation claims; no behavior change.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Align the devDependency pins to the published dsh `0.1.2-alpha.3` line and align `cordis`/`schemastery` dev pins to `^4.0.2`/`^3.18.2`. The pre-flight `session/pin` gate behavior is unchanged on `0.1.2-alpha.3` (the vocabulary still lacks the type and `Session.append` still cannot stamp the `ignorable` marker); the five-language READMEs record the alpha.3 fact.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- **Pre-flight `session/pin` append gate** (`src/pin-log.ts`): `PinLogAppender` now probes the host's ability to carry the `session/pin` event BEFORE the first write instead of appending first and probing the returned envelope after. A host can carry the event only when its known event vocabulary (`KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES`) covers the type or its append implementation still stamps the `ignorable` envelope marker (source-probed and cached per process). On hosts where neither holds — `0.1.2-alpha.1` removed the envelope and its read path fails closed on unknown types — no append is ever written (the previous write-then-probe order poisoned the log on first use) and the projection degrades to the settings cache with a one-time warning. `allowUnmarked` keeps the dangerous opt-in; `isMarkedIgnorable` remains exported for result-envelope probing.
- **Client seam migration off `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime`** (removed from current hosts): `src/client.ts` now reads the `SessionId`/`WorkspaceId` brands from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-connection/client`, and `src/ui.ts` types the session-header standard-kit seats (`sessionId`, `useProjection`) as a local structural contract instead of importing the removed package's merge. `dsh.client.inject` migrates from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` to the surviving client rows (`dsh-client-connection`, `dsh-client-ui-conversation`, `dsh-client-ui-sidebar`, `dsh-client-ui-layout`, `dsh-client-ui-settings`); peer ranges follow the family baseline and the optional-peer table mirrors the new list.
- **Row-slot degrade verified on `0.1.2-alpha.1`**: host HEAD declares no `sessions.row.action` slot (grep-verified), so the row-slot registration stays deferred through `slots.inject` and session rows fall back to the DOM overlay — no throw, no duplicate pin sets. Covered by the new `tests/row-slot.test.ts`.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Declare the web-client inject packages (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime`,
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-settings`) as optional peerDependencies so the
  bundle composition is explicit and standalone installs stay clean.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Log-backed canonical pin residence** (`enableLogBacking`, default false): a new `src/pin-log.ts` module defines the `session/pin` structured event, the pure projection fold that rebuilds the canonical pin set from a session log, and the ignorable-gated append seam. When enabled, the host half folds live `session/event` pins back into the canonical set and mirrors the folded `pinned`/`colors` into the settings namespace as an idempotent cache — the session log is authoritative, and the settings namespace plus browser-local storage remain the compat/degradation path. Workspace pins, both color maps' workspace half, and organizer metadata stay plugin-local and never ride the session log.

### Changed

- **Toolchain metadata**: CI pins pnpm to the `packageManager` version (pnpm@11.7.0) and Renovate is enabled via the shared `dsh-plugin-kit` preset. No plugin behavior changed.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Board/tag write UI**: the board chip row now creates, renames, and deletes boards and drag-reorders them (order persists per-browser), and every pinned panel row gains a manage button that assigns its board and edits its tags — closing the organizer's write-side gap (`PinController.createBoard`/`renameBoard`/`removeBoard`/`assignBoard`/`setTags` are now reachable from the GUI).
- **Collapsible board grouping**: the pinned panel groups its workspaces and sessions by board under collapsible headers (ungrouped pins last), driven by the new `groupPinnedByBoard`/`reorderBoards`/`suggestBoardId` pure helpers. Existing pins, colors, and the four pin surfaces are unchanged.

### Changed

- **Package standards**: declare `packageManager: pnpm@11.7.0` and `engines.node: ^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` in `package.json` to match the compat workflow's toolchain and the ecosystem engine floor. Metadata only — no plugin behavior changed.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **DeepSeek Harness rc.2 compatibility**: every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` development dependency moves from `0.1.0-rc.8` to the exact `0.1.1-rc.2`, and the workshop manifest, READMEs, compat workflow, and `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` declare `0.1.1-rc.2`. No plugin code changed — all gates (typecheck, unit tests, coverage, lint, readme sync, build, self-contained, artifacts) pass against the rc.2 family, and the bundle mounts in a real rc.2 headless profile completing a keyless mock-LLM round trip.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **DeepSeek Harness rc.8 compatibility**: every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` development dependency moves from `0.1.0-rc.6` to the exact `0.1.0-rc.8`, the `dsh-settings` peer range widens to `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0`, and the workshop manifest, READMEs, and compat workflow declare rc.8. No plugin code changed — all gates (typecheck, unit tests, coverage, lint, readme sync, build, self-contained, artifacts) pass against the rc.8 family, and the bundle mounts in a real rc.8 headless profile completing a keyless mock-LLM round trip.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- **Client dictionaries survive hot-reload**: the browser half now holds the `locale.register` disposer on the locale inject scope's fiber (`ctx.effect`; the locale registry throws on a duplicate namespace). Disposing the client fiber unregisters the `session-pin` dictionaries; remounting re-registers cleanly instead of throwing the duplicate-namespace error. Regression covered by a dispose-and-remount client test against a duplicate-strict locale registry.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **Pin groups (boards)**: pins join named groups (`pin.createBoard` / `pin.assignBoard` / `pin.removeBoard`); the pinned panel shows board chips that filter to one group (plus "All"). Boards persist per-browser with the pins (store envelope v3; v1/v2 documents migrate forward).
- **Session tags & saved views**: entities carry up to 8 tags (≤24 chars); the panel's filter bar matches text (case-insensitive title substring) and tags, and any filter state saves as a named view (up to 20, one-click restore).
- **Session health summary**: each pinned session row shows a read-only, sanitized health line (`N msgs · you|ai · relative time`) derived from the public session snapshot — counts and directions only, never content, zero network.
- **`/goto <keyword>`**: a composer line starting with `/goto` plus Enter jumps to the matching session (unique hit opens, multiple hits list, no hit explains); the command line is never sent to the model.
- Five Config switches (`enableBoards` / `enableTags` / `enableViews` / `enableHealth` / `enableGoto`, default true) and matching settings-namespace fields; `src/navigator.ts` holds the pure organizer logic (boards/tags/views/filter/health/goto/sanitize) with unit coverage.

### Changed

- Pin, color, and the four pin surfaces are fully unchanged (0.3.x compatible); the store envelope moves v2 → v3 with forward migration.
- Five-language READMEs: navigation-organizer section and the five new Config rows; test count updated to 87.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **Bundle manifest**: `package.json` now declares a complete `dsh.bundle` manifest (`cordis.patch.yml` shipped in `files`), so the plugin installs with one command — `dsh plugin --profile <profile> add dsh-session-pin` — instead of a manual `cordis.yml` row.
- **Plugin Family cross-links**: the READMEs (English / 中文) now link the full PerryLink DSH plugin family.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- **Workspace-level pins**: workspace header rows get the same pin controls as session rows; pinning a workspace moves it to the front of the workspace list (`workspace.insertBefore`).
- **Row colors**: a swatch after each pin cycles an 8-color preset palette (Shift+click clears); colored rows get a left accent bar plus a translucent tint, per level (session / workspace), persisted in settings or the v2 `localStorage` envelope.
- **Duplicate-pin fix**: on builds declaring the upstream `sessions.row.action` slot, the DOM overlay skips session rows entirely — a row can never show two pin sets; the overlay now observes the document body instead of the first `role="tree"` container, and re-renders on slot-registry changes.
- **Pinned panel** now lists both levels (workspaces + sessions) with color dots; the footer count includes both.
- Storage envelope **v2** with automatic migration of v1 / legacy bare-array documents.
- CI workflow (`ci`: typecheck, test, build), issue forms, PR template, `SECURITY.md`.

### Changed

- `maxPins` now applies **per level** (sessions and workspaces each have their own budget).
- Overlay click handling is routed by row kind, so a session row whose title collides with a workspace label can never toggle a workspace pin.
- Runtime probes guard newer service methods (`slots.subscribe/snapshot`, `workspace.insertBefore/startSession`) so older baselines degrade gracefully.
- READMEs synchronized across all five languages (English is the source).
- **Package renamed to unscoped `dsh-session-pin`** ahead of the first publish: the `@dsh-external` npm scope belongs to a retired DSH-beta organization and cannot be published into by third parties (403 for non-members).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Lucide-style pin badge with hover reveal and pinned state.
- Live verification script (`scripts/verify-live.mjs`) driving a headless browser against a running `dsh web`.
- Five-language READMEs (English · 中文 · Español · Português · हिन्दी) with demo screenshots.

### Changed

- Exposed `package.json` as a subpath export; aligned persistence docs with the DSH wire allowlist.
- Relicensed to Apache-2.0.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Initial release: pin sessions in the DSH web sidebar with a hover pin badge, session-header toggle, pinned-sessions panel, durable `session-pin` settings namespace, and top ordering via `workspace.insertSessionBefore`.
