/**
 * Reorder pump: the re-entrancy guard in front of the browser half's
 * pinned-prefix re-assertion.
 *
 * The glue re-asserts pinned order on every list change, and every reorder it
 * issues comes back as a list change — the host broadcasts the persisted order,
 * and the sidebar churns on unrelated session activity too. `reorderMoves`
 * plans its moves for SEQUENTIAL application (oldest pin first, so repeated
 * insert-before-the-current-head calls end with the newest pin first), but the
 * glue issued the batch concurrently, so every move computed its anchor from
 * the same pre-move snapshot. With three or more pinned sessions in one account
 * the resulting order is not the pinned prefix, the next event plans the same
 * moves again, and the client never stops POSTing
 * `workspace/insertSessionBefore` — issue #4: tens of thousands of requests
 * until `net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`.
 *
 * The pump gives the re-assertion three properties:
 *
 * 1. **One pass at a time.** A trigger that lands while a pass is running is
 *    coalesced into a single re-check after it settles, so the echo of this
 *    client's own confirmed move cannot re-enter the reorder path.
 * 2. **Sequential moves.** The plan is applied one move at a time, each move
 *    re-reading the live order — the contract the plan is built for.
 * 3. **One issuance per observed order.** A plan is issued at most once for a
 *    given observed order: replaying the same request sequence against the same
 *    order cannot change that order, which is exactly the loop. A real order
 *    change re-arms issuance, and so does {@link ReorderPump.reset} on a
 *    transport reconnect.
